Simple Q&A
==========

This is a simple jQuery-powered page I made for doing question and answer sessions. Prior to the event, add as many questions as you want using the big '+' sign at the bottom. Click the 'x' to delete a question. When you're ready to start, click on the title to show all of the answer boxes and fill in the answers you recieve. Once the Q&A is complete, you can save the results by printing out the page (or save them digitally by printing to PDF).
